### Description
This is the capstone project for the DataTalks Club ML Zoomcamp 2024.

In this project we will build a traffic sign classification web service.

This web service will take images of traffic signs and classify them. This kind of service could also be used in a self driven car. The car cameras could scan the road for traffic signs and when they find one, the system can classify the sign so that the car could decide what to do. For example if the cameras find a STOP sign, the car would stop.

### Dataset

We will use the **GTSRB - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark** dataset from Kaggle. The dataset can be found in the URL below:

The two folders we are interested in, are:

* **Train**. All traffic sign images are stored here. You can find 43 folders, and in each folder you can find the images for a specific traffic sign. We will use this folder for model training.
* **Test**. We will use the images in this folder to test our model after it is trained.
